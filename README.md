# arabtype_js
This is a porting of https://github.com/eloraiby/arabtype repository for Javascript with simplify

## Info
Functions have been simplified to take one string and return another.

## Use
```javascript
let newTextString = get_presentation_form_b(oldTextString);
```

## Important
I cannot vouch for its result and I can not check it out.
If you can check it out and improve it, I will only be happy.
